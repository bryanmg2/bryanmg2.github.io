<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>How do I know if they are taking advantage of me?</p>
<p>Where is my money going?</p>

<p>These 5 institutions of higher education in Oregon are legitimate schools that confer bachelor's degrees and <i>invest</i>
more money in their students' education than they receive in revenue from the students.</p>


<ul>
<li>Oregon Health & Science University</li>
<li>Oregon Institute of Technology</li>
<li>Portland State University</li>
<li>Southern Oregon University</li>
<li>Western Oregon University</li>
</ul>

To answer Steve Jobs' question, "is it worth it" for working-class parents to
send their kids to these schools? Unequivocally, yes: The State of Oregon,
despite its meager resources, is essentially <i>paying</i> people to get
degrees at these institutions as an investment in the State's future success.</p>

<p>In the case of OHSU, Oregon invests almost $50,000/yr. <b>per Student</b> for Oregonians
to go to medical school, study Bioinformatics, or get a degree in a field related to
Healthcare. That's an <i>amazing</i> benefit no matter what State you live in.</p>
