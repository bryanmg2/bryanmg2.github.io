<h1>Conclusion</h1>


<p>Based on the data, we can conclude that these 5 institutions of higher education in
Oregon are not only legitimate schools that confer bachelor's degrees, they also <i>invest</i>
more money in their students' education than they receive in revenue from the students:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/education/programs-and-schools">Oregon Health & Science University</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees">Oregon Institute of Technology</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pdx.edu/academic-programs">Portland State University</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sou.edu/academics/">Southern Oregon University</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wou.edu/academics/">Western Oregon University</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To answer Steve Jobs' question, "is it worth it" for working-class parents to
send their kids to these schools? Unequivocally, yes: The State of Oregon,
despite its meager resources, is essentially <i>paying</i> people to get
degrees at these institutions as an investment in the State's future.

In the case of OHSU, Oregon is investing almost $50,000/yr. <b>per Student</b> for Oregonians
to go to medical school, study Bioinformatics, or get a degree in a field related to
Healthcare. That's an <i>amazing</i> benefit no matter what State you live in.</p>

<p>Having said that, it would be incorrect to assume the other schools in Oregon
don't provide value. Reed is an amazing college, even if Steve Jobs couldn't see
the value in the money his parents were spending at the time. He went on to say
of his experience at Reed, "much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity
and intuition turned out to be priceless later on."<sup>1</sup> My goal in
demonstrating the value of these 5 colleges is to convince prospective students
of their value <i>up front</i>, so when they come to those difficult moments
in their college years, they already know how to value their experiences, even
before they come to realize how priceless their college experience was later in
life.</p>
