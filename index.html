<h1>How to pick a College in the State of Oregon?</h1>

<p>Steve Jobs said of Reed College (a private liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon), "I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK."<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>If Steve Jobs couldn't figure out how to determine the value of his education at the time, how can we expect others to have better success, especially in a mostly rural State where many families have never had any experience with college whatsoever? How can first generation college students and their families figure out how best to spend their money on higher education in Oregon?

What's more, Oregon ranks 46<sup>th</sup> in the country in state spending per student in higher education.<sup>2</sup>
With the State subsidizing so little of higher education in Oregon, how can Oregon residents
determine which schools provide the most benefit from the very limited resources they have available to them?</p>

<p>Not all schools are created equally, nor benefit their students equally.
The first step is to understand which insitutions are reputable 
and grant credentials that are generally recognized as valid in both academia and industry.</p>
