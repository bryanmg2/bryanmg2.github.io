<p>Steve Jobs famously said of Reed College (a Private University in Portland, Oregon), "I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK."</p>

<p>If Steve Jobs couldn't figure out how to determine the value of his education at the time, how can we expect others to have better success, especially those from families who have never had any experience with college whatsoever? How can first generation college students and their families figure out how best to spend their money on higher education in Oregon?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Oregon ranks 46th in the country in state spending per student in higher education.<sup>1</sup>
So, how can residents of Oregon make the most of the very limited resources they have available to them?


How can parents be assured they are not being taken advantage of?


<p>Not all schools are created equally, nor benefit their students equally. The first step is to understand
